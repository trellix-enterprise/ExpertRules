This rule trigger indicates the detection of Zloader banking trojan which arrives as spam containing word document as an attachment. When the document is opened and macros are enabled, it downloads a malicous excel file. This excel macro downloads Zloader dll from a malicious URL and executes by invoking rundll32.exe. This rule detects and blocks this behaviour of excel.exe.
