# T1134.004 - Access Token Manipulation: Parent PID Spoofing

## Author
Elad levi

## Description
This expert rule identifies attempts to manipulate the parent process ID (PID) of a newly created process. It does so by detecting processes that try to open a handle to another process with the `PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS` access mask. Attackers often use this technique to conceal malicious processes or avoid detection by mimicking the characteristics of legitimate parent processes.

## Rule Class 
Process

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
	Process {
		Include OBJECT_NAME {
			-v **
		}
		# Exclude processes signed by a Trellix or Microsoft
		Exclude VTP_TRUST true
	}
	Target {
		Match PROCESS {
			Include OBJECT_NAME {
				-v **
			}
			Include NT_ACCESS_MASK {
				# PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS
				-v "0x0080"
			}
			# Exclude PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS
			Include NT_ACCESS_MASK {
				-v "!0x1fffff"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Tested Platforms
NA

## Notes
- Customers are advised to fine-tune the rule in their environment or disable the signature if there are false positives.
- If the attacker opens handle with PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS this signature will not detect it.
