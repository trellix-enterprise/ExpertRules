# T1055 - Process Injection via RWX Memory Allocation

## Author
Elad levi

## Description
This detection signature identifies potential process injection attempts by monitoring the creation of memory sections with Read-Write-Execute (RWX) permissions, which is often used to load and execute malicious code within another process's memory space.

## Rule Class 
Process

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
	Initiator {
		Match PROCESS {
			Include OBJECT_NAME {
				-v **
			}
			# Exclude processes signed by a Trellix or Microsoft
			Exclude VTP_TRUST true
		}
	}
	Target {
		Match PROCESS {
			Include OBJECT_NAME {
				-v **
			}
			Include -access "WRITE"
			Exclude -access "DELETE"
			# Exclude every memory protection execpt PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40)
			Include NT_ACCESS_MASK {
				-v "!0x10"
				-v "!0x20"
				-v "!0x80"
				-v "!0x01"
				-v "!0x02"
				-v "!0x04"
				-v "!0x08"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Tested Platforms
NA

## Notes
- Customers are advised to fine-tune the rule in their environment or disable the signature if there are false positives.
